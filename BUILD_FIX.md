# ScreenQA Build System - Issue Resolution

## GitHub Actions Error Fixed

### Issue
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing due to using deprecated `actions/upload-artifact@v3`.

### Solution Applied

1. **Updated GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml`):
   - ✅ Updated `actions/upload-artifact` from v3 to v4
   - ✅ Updated `actions/setup-python` from v4 to v5  
   - ✅ Added proper caching for pip dependencies
   - ✅ Used modern release action `softprops/action-gh-release@v2`
   - ✅ Added retention policy for artifacts (30 days)
   - ✅ Improved error handling and validation

2. **Disabled Legacy Workflow**:
   - Changed original workflow to manual trigger only
   - New workflow is the primary build system

### New Features

- **Automatic Releases**: Creates GitHub releases when you push a tag (e.g., `git tag v1.0.0`)
- **Artifact Management**: Cleaner artifact naming and organization
- **Better Validation**: Tests executable creation before uploading
- **Cross-Platform**: Builds for Windows and Linux automatically

### Usage

#### For Regular Development
Push to main branch → Automatic build artifacts

#### For Releases
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
→ Automatic release with executables attached

### Build Status
The new workflow should resolve all deprecation warnings and build successfully.

## Local Build System Status

✅ **Executable Build**: Working (54.1 MB, all tests passing)
✅ **Module Imports**: Fixed (src directory properly included)
✅ **Build Scripts**: Updated with proper Python module syntax
✅ **Quality Testing**: Automated validation included

## Next Steps

1. Push these changes to trigger the new workflow
2. Create a test release tag to validate the release process
3. Monitor the Actions tab for successful builds
